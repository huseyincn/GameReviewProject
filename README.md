# GameReviewProject
This project is the first project of my android app. <br> 
I use the MVVM architectural design pattern to create. <br> 
I retrieved data from rawg.io made synchronous and asynchronous calls to service, and parsed the JSON with Moshi. <br> 
I had some failures in this project, like don't show the data without refreshing recyclerView at first and don't have the repository class to make calls apart view classes. <br>
I am open to any suggestions and invitations so don't hesitate to get contact me on LinkedIn: <br>

API KEY is shared openly and now it isn't working so if you want to use the application, you need to provide new API key from api.rawg.io. <br>
Here are the some screenshots of my mobile application. <br>
